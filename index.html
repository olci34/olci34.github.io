      <img src="ben.jpg" alt="portrait" id="photo" />
      <p>
        Recent Flatiron School grad. Holding a (BS) Maritime Transportation and
        Management Engineering degree. Picked up interest in software
        development after being introduced to MATLAB in college. Statistics and
        Mathematics studies helped me to build analytical thinking and problem
        solving skills. Migrating USA alone after college has taught me
        perseverance, proactiveness and adoptability. Started self learning iOS
        Programming with Swift. Then decided to explore web development via
        bootcamp. Still curious about mobile app development and expanding my
        knowledge of web development. Currently engaging in AWS Cloud Computing.
        Love challenging myself, solving problems with using different
        approaches, adapting new skills, listening to podcasts, traveling,
        producing music, drawing and playing soccer.

              A single page application that allows users to book trips to the
              planets in 3D platform. Rails, React and Redux frameworks are
              used. This was my first React project. My purpose was mainly
              getting comfortable with creating functional and class components,
              adapting newly introduced hooks, using Redux store efficiently and
              having a better understanding of React lifecycle methods. Trending
              space traveling news were birth place of the project idea. Also
              this was a great opportunity to explore Three.js library which is
              a cross-browser JS library that ables creating 3D interactive
              objects using WebGL. Playing with 3D objects, angles, vectors got
              me back to high school and college years. I am amazed by what
              Three.js can bring to frontend. Recently, I am still working on
              adding features such as displaying QR code tickets.

              Dance Memory is basically a memory card game. However, front side
              of these cards are fun dancing stickers. It is also a single page
              application which runs Ruby on Rails in backend and vanilla
              JavaScript in frontend. The project idea was inspired by Stanford
              University Developing iOS 11 with Swift lecture that I watched to
              self-learn iOS programming on YouTube. This was a great
              opportunity to practice REST API and AJAX techniques. Running CRUD
              actions based on user interaction helped me to establish web
              application flow between backend and frontend.

              A Rails app where users can purchase or sell ice creams from their
              own ice cream truck. The idea was to keep the ice cream truck
              culture alive. One of the challenges I faced in this project was
              building multiple many-to-many relationships between models.
              Active Record was a great tool to come over this obstacle. Also
              developing nested forms and model methods that respond to them was
              another learning experience. The app provides user authentication
              with Facebook using OAuth. Bcrypt is implemented to keep user
              password safe in database.
